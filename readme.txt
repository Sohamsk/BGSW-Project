GOALS:
1 > Lexical analysis	- Sameer
2 > Semantic anlaysis**	- Soham | Mohit
3 > IR VB Generation	- Piyush

Lexical analyis -> Get tokens from the file and make it so that the parser can parse it
Semantic analysis -> Figure out if there is any tool which can help in parsing if not then figure out how parsers work and make one ourselves
IR Generation -> **Currently blocked by semantic analysis**

Currently tools to consider
1 > ANTLR (can work as both lexer and parser)
2 >
